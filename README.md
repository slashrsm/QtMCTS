# About this project #

This project was implemented during author's university studies about Monte Carlo 
tree search (MCTS) [1]. MCTS is a relatively unknown algorithm, that proved itself
to be quite appropriate for Go.

The goal of this project was to implement and test MCTS on chess endgames. We were
particularly interested in KBNK endgame [2], which is currently to hard to solve without 
the perfect information.

We were, however, unable to solve KBNK, but we had quite a lot of success with KRK endgame [3], 
which is slightly easier to solve. No work has been done on this project for about two years, 
since it author completely changed it's professional/working focus.
